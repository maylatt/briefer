## What is Briefer

Briefer is like Notion for code notebooks and dashboards. It gives technical users all the flexibility they need to publish dashboards, analyze data, create reports, and build data apps. At the same time, Briefer makes it easy for non-technical users to view and interact with data.

In Briefer, you can:

- üìöüìä **Create notebooks and dashboards** using Markdown, Python, SQL, and native visualizations.
- ü§≥ **Build interactive data apps** using inputs, dropdowns, and date pickers.
- üï∞Ô∏è **Schedule notebooks and dashboards** to run and update periodically.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Create and test ad-hoc pipelines** using writebacks.
- ü§ñ **Generate code and queries** using an AI that understands your database schema and your notebook's context.

In addition to all that, Briefer is also multiplayer, meaning two or more people can work on the same notebook or dashboard at the same time and see each other's changes in real-time.

## Getting started

There are three ways to set up Briefer. You can install it on your machine for individual use, sign up for the cloud for a more convenient collaborative workspace, or you can deploy it to your own infrastructure. All of these options are free.

We recommend that you either sign-up for the cloud or deploy it yourself. That way, your whole team will be able to collaborate in Briefer.
